## Project Brutality Voxel Patch v1

#### This Version of the project is depreciated. While it may recieve maintenance patches, it most likely not be recieving any new features or models.
> You can find the new version of the project here: [PBVP v2](https://github.com/D3X1KAXYZ/PBVPv2 "Project Brutality Voxel Patch v2")
 
 This version is outdated and contains a mix of polymesh and voxel models. We were in the middle of converting over to polymesh in order to increase performance, however this version has become too much for me too work with, so we decided to restart. This version (as of 8/3/20) still works with current builds of pb3.0 and can be run with the PBVP v2 (just load v1 first.)
 
 *Warning: The voxel renderer of zdoom based source ports poorly optimized and will cause heavy lag. To help with this, there are keybinds that allow you to turn off voxels instantly,(provided your game has not stopped responding.) Make sure to set this up.*
 *PB3.0 and PBVP are in active development.There will be bugs. Things will break. Use at your own risk.*

[It is best practice to ask first](https://discord.gg/T6ktBwB "My Discord"), but I also understand that I will not always be around to ask, so giving Credit is the least you can do (even if you make modifications).
