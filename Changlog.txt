INITIAL LIST

==[VOXELS]==
Currently, we are converting over to polymesh.
With polymesh conversion, we can reduce lag, build larger models, and more.
Does this mean this is no longer a voxel pack?
No, not really.
Sure its not using the voxel renderer, but all of our models are voxels.
No smooth slopes, not odd angles, no textures.
This is because all models are converted from voxels.
...
This is a mess.
Its a mix of several voxel packs.
All non PBVP voxels are placeholders.
They will hopefully be replaced in the final build.
Anything marked with as (redux) on ''this list'' is a modified voxel. 
Anything marked with (#.1) is an "original redux"
All weapons from "PB 3.0 Test build 1-21-18" have voxels.
The following list may be missing some items due to a lack of commenting and labeling. My bad.

==[MODELS]==
Due the strict nature of MODELDEF, this list is much neater and fully documented.
I split the list by type and file.
The format of this list for all OBJ models are as follows:
Actor_name					NAME FRAMES	(notes)
NAME is the sprite name being replaced by models.
(A-) means that all frames are handled by the same model.
(Filename.obj) means the model name does not match the sprite name.

(?)
Not sure whats with this one. 
Sprite frame B is being handled by the model for frame D 
Models A-C are not in the mod yet.
Definitions for sprites A,C,and D are missing.
Not sure what I was doing.
